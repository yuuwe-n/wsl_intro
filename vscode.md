# vscode

follow these steps to get vscode to work with wsl [wsl-vscode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode)

i am not on windows or linux rn (openbsd gang), so i don't even have vscode, but here is what i am assuming

in wsl, you can use `code .` meaning, open vscode in your current directory, remember "." means current dir

OR, you can just use the vscode plugin do that stuff

since i don't really know how that plugin works, we move on to documentation with markdown


there are stuff you need to learn with vscode spefically that I don't really want to research myself cuz i dont use vscode:

1. switching your terminal to wsl
2. accessing wsl from vscode
3. plugins for wsl
4. plugins for your languages (linters, real time preview)
5. plugin for markdown preview
6. i cant think of more rn
