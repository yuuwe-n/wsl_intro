# vscode

follow these steps to get vscode to work with wsl [wsl-vscode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode)

i am not on windows or linux rn (openbsd gang), so i don't even have vscode, but here is what i am assuming

in wsl, you can use `code .` meaning, open vscode in your current directory, remember "." means current dir

OR, you can just use the vscode plugin do that stuff


since i don't really know how that plugin works, we move on to documentation with markdown
[markdown](markdown.md)
